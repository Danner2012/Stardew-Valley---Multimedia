## Basic usage
1. Create an empty library project.
2. Reference the [`Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig).
3. [Write your code](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Creating_a_SMAPI_mod).
4. Compile on any platform.
5. Run the game to play with your mod.

## Features
The package includes several features to simplify mod development (see [_configure_](#configure) to
change how these work).

### Detect game path<span id="custom-game-path"></span>
The package...
- finds your game folder by scanning the default install paths and Windows registry;
- sets up your project so the code can reference SMAPI and game code;
- and adds two MSBuild properties for use in your `.csproj` file if needed: `$(GamePath)` and `$(GameModsPath)`.

> [!TIP]
> If it can't find your game or you have multiple installs, you can specify the path yourself. To
> do that:
>
> 1. Find your computer's home folder (see instructions for [Linux](https://superuser.com/a/409223),
>    [macOS](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-find-your-macs-home-folder-and-add-it-to-finder/),
>    or [Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000109.htm)).
> 2. Create a `stardewvalley.targets` file with this content:
>    ```xml
>    <Project>
>       <PropertyGroup>
>          <GamePath>PATH_HERE</GamePath>
>       </PropertyGroup>
>    </Project>
>    ```
> 3. Replace `PATH_HERE` with the full folder path containing the Stardew Valley executable.
>
> See [_configure_](#configure) for more info.

### Install and debug your mod<span id="deploy"></span>
The package automatically installs your mod when you build the code, and sets up Visual Studio so
it can launch the game and debug your code. That lets you try the mod in-game right after building
it.

> [!TIP]
> Here's how to use the features in Visual Studio.
>
> <dl>
> <dt>To install and run your mod:</dt>
> <dd>
>
> 1. Open the code in Visual Studio.
> 2. Click _Build > Rebuild Solution_ to copy the mod files into your game folder.
> 3. Click _Debug > Start Without Debugging_ to launch the game.
>
> </dd>
>
> <dt>To debug your mod code:</dt>
> <dd>
>
> On Windows only, use _Debug > Start Debugging_ instead to launch the game with a debugger. That
> lets you [set breakpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints)
> or [make simple changes code without needing to restart the game](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue).
>
> (Debugging is disabled on Linux/macOS due to limitations with the Mono wrapper.)
>
> </dd>
> </dl>

> [!TIP]
> The package automatically detects which files need to be included. If you need to change that:
> * For normal files, you can [add/remove them in the build output](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10828462/262123).
> * For assembly files (`*.dll`, `*.exe`, `*.pdb`, or `*.xml`), see the [`BundleExtraAssemblies`
>   option](#configure).
> * To exclude a file which the package copies by default, see the [`IgnoreModFilePaths` or
>   `IgnoreModFilePatterns` options](#configure).

### Release zip
The package adds a zip file in your project's `bin` folder when you rebuild the code, in the format
recommended for uploading to mod sites like Nexus Mods.

See [_install and debug your mod_](#deploy) for more info. You can also [change where the zips are
stored](#configure).

### Bundled content packs
You can bundle any number of [content packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Content_pack_frameworks)
with your main C# mod. They'll be grouped with the main mod into a parent folder automatically,
which will be [copied to the `Mods` folder](#deploy) and included in [the release zip](#release-zip).

To do that, add an `ItemGroup` with a `ContentPacks` line for each content pack you want to include:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <ContentPacks Include="content packs/[CP] SomeContentPack" Version="$(Version)" />
    <ContentPacks Include="content packs/[CP] AnotherContentPack" Version="$(Version)" />
</ItemGroup>
```

You can use these properties for each line:

property                | effect
----------------------- | ------
`Include`               | _(Required)_ The path to the content pack folder. This can be an absolute path, or relative to the current project.
`Version`               | _(Required)_ The expected version of the content pack. This should usually be the same version as your main mod, to keep update alerts in sync. The package will validate that the included content pack's manifest version matches.
`FolderName`            | _(Optional)_ The content pack folder name to create. Defaults to the folder name from `Include`.
`ValidateManifest`      | _(Optional)_ Whether to validate that the included mod has a valid `manifest.json` file and version. Default `true`.
`IgnoreModFilePaths`    | _(Optional)_ A list of file paths to ignore (relative to the content pack's directory); see `IgnoreModFilePaths` in the main settings. Default none.
`IgnoreModFilePatterns` | _(Optional)_ A list of file regex patterns to ignore (relative to the content pack's directory); see `IgnoreModFilePatterns` in the main settings. Default none.

### Manifest tokens
It's best practices in .NET to set the code version in your `.csproj` project file. For example:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
</PropertyGroup>
```

If you do, you can use `%ProjectVersion%` in your [`manifest.json`](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest).
This will be replaced with your project version automatically in your [game folder](#deploy) and [the release zip](#release-zip).

For example:
```js
{
    "Name": "Your Mod Name",
    "Author": "Your Name",
    "Version": "%ProjectVersion%",
    ...
}
```

This also works with [bundled content packs](#bundled-content-packs). When your mod consists of
multiple parts, this lets you keep their versions in sync automatically.

### Code warnings
The package runs code analysis on your mod and raises warnings for some common errors or pitfalls
specific to Stardew Valley modding.

For example:  
> ![screenshot](screenshots/code-analyzer-example.png)

You can [hide the warnings](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2017/09/01/hide-compiler-warnings.aspx)
if needed using the warning ID (shown under 'code' in Visual Studio's Error List).

Warnings raised:

<table>
<tr>
<th>error</th>
<th>info</th>
</tr>
<tr id="avoid-net-field">
<td>Avoid net field</td>
<td>

Warning text:
> '{{expression}}' is a {{net type}} field; consider using the {{property name}} property instead.

Your code accesses a net field, but the game has an equivalent non-net property.

Suggested fix: access the suggested property name instead.

</td>
</tr>
<tr id="avoid-obsolete-field">
<td>Avoid obsolete field</td>
<td>

Warning text:
> The '{{old field}}' field is obsolete and should be replaced with '{{new field}}'.

Your code accesses a field which is obsolete or no longer works. Use the suggested field instead.

</td>
</tr>
<tr id="wrong-processor-architecture">
<td>Wrong processor architecture</td>
<td>

Warning text:
> The target platform should be set to 'Any CPU' for compatibility with both 32-bit and 64-bit
> versions of Stardew Valley (currently set to '{{current platform}}').

Mods can be used in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode. Your project's target platform isn't set to the
default 'Any CPU', so it won't work in both. You can fix it by [setting the target platform to
'Any CPU'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/visualstudio/ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-platforms).

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Unit tests
You can use the projects to set up unit test and framework projects too. (Note that you still need
a game install on the machine running the tests.)

Recommended settings for a unit test project (see [_configure_](#configure)):
```xml
<EnableGameDebugging>false</EnableGameDebugging>
<EnableModDeploy>false</EnableModDeploy>
<EnableModZip>false</EnableModZip>
<BundleExtraAssemblies>All</BundleExtraAssemblies>
```

### Other features
The package preconfigures your Visual Studio project using the recommended settings for Stardew
Valley mods. For example, it enables debug symbols so error logs show line numbers to simplify
debugging.

## Configure
### How to set options
You can configure the package by setting build properties, which are essentially tags like this:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <ModFolderName>CustomModName</ModFolderName>
    <EnableModDeploy>false</EnableModDeploy>
</PropertyGroup>
```

There are two places you can put them:

* **Global properties** apply to every mod project you open on your computer. That's recommended
  for properties you want to set for all mods (e.g. a custom game path). Here's where to put them:

  1. Open the home folder on your computer (see instructions for
     [Linux](https://superuser.com/a/409223),
     [macOS](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-find-your-macs-home-folder-and-add-it-to-finder/),
     or [Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000109.htm)).
  2. Create a `stardewvalley.targets` file with this content:
     ```xml
     <Project>
        <PropertyGroup>
        </PropertyGroup>
     </Project>
     ```
  3. Add the properties between the `<PropertyGroup>` and `</PropertyGroup>`.

* **Project properties** apply to a specific project. This is mainly useful for mod-specific
  options like the mod name. Here's where to put them:

  1. Open the folder containing your mod's source code.
  2. Open the `.csproj` file in a text editor (Notepad is fine).
  3. Add the properties between the first `<PropertyGroup>` and `</PropertyGroup>` tags you find.

**Note:** you can't use a property before it's defined. That mainly means that when setting
`GameModsPath`, you'll need to either specify `GamePath` manually or put the full path in
`GameModsPath`.

### Available properties
These are the options you can set.

#### Common properties
property       | effect
-------------- | ------
`GamePath`     | The absolute path to the Stardew Valley folder. This is auto-detected, so you usually don't need to change it.
`GameModsPath` | The absolute path to the folder containing the game's installed mods (defaults to `$(GamePath)/Mods`), used when deploying the mod files.

#### Mod build properties
property          | effect
----------------- | ------
`EnableHarmony`   | Whether to add a reference to [Harmony][] (default `false`). This is only needed if you use Harmony.
`EnableModDeploy` | Whether to copy the mod files into your game's `Mods` folder (default `true`).
`EnableModZip`    | Whether to create a release-ready `.zip` file in the mod project's `bin` folder (default `true`).
`ModFolderName`   | The mod name for its folder under `Mods` and its release zip (defaults to the project name).
`ModZipPath`      | The folder path where the release zip is created (defaults to the project's `bin` folder).

#### Specialized properties
These properties should usually be left as-is.

property                | effect
----------------------- | ------
`EnableGameDebugging`   | Whether to configure the project so you can launch or debug the game through the _Debug_ menu in Visual Studio (default `true`). There's usually no reason to change this, unless it's a unit test project.
`IgnoreModFilePaths`    | A comma-delimited list of literal file paths to ignore, relative to the mod's `bin` folder. Paths are case-sensitive, but path delimiters are normalized automatically. For example, this ignores a set of tilesheets: `<IgnoreModFilePaths>assets/paths.png, assets/springobjects.png</IgnoreModFilePaths>`.
`IgnoreModFilePatterns` | A comma-delimited list of regex patterns matching files to ignore when deploying or zipping the mod files (default empty). For crossplatform compatibility, you should replace path delimiters with `[/\\]`. For example, this excludes all `.txt` and `.pdf` files, as well as the `assets/paths.png` file: `<IgnoreModFilePatterns>\.txt$, \.pdf$, assets[/\\]paths.png</IgnoreModFilePatterns>`.

#### `BundleExtraAssemblies`
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a specialized option. Most mods should not change this option.

By default (when this is _not_ enabled), only the mod files [normally considered part of the
mod](#deploy) will be added to the release `.zip` and copied into the `Mods` folder (i.e.
"deployed"). That includes the assembly files (`*.dll`, `*.pdb`, and `*.xml`) for your mod project,
but any other DLLs won't be deployed.

Enabling this option will add _all_ dependencies to the build output, then deploy _some_ of them
depending on the comma-separated value(s) you set:

option       | result
------------ | ------
`ThirdParty` | Assembly files which don't match any other category.
`System`     | Assembly files whose names start with `Microsoft.*` or `System.*`.
`Game`       | Assembly files which are part of MonoGame, SMAPI, or Stardew Valley.
`All`        | Equivalent to `System, Game, ThirdParty`.

Most mods should omit the option. Some mods may need `ThirdParty` if they bundle third-party DLLs
with their mod. The other options are mainly useful for unit tests.

When enabling this option, you should **manually review which files get deployed** and use the
`IgnoreModFilePaths` or `IgnoreModFilePatterns` options to exclude files as needed.

## For SMAPI developers
The mod build package consists of three projects:

project                                           | purpose
------------------------------------------------- | ----------------
`StardewModdingAPI.ModBuildConfig`                | Configures the build (references, deploying the mod files, setting up debugging, etc).
`StardewModdingAPI.ModBuildConfig.Analyzer`       | Adds C# analyzers which show code warnings in Visual Studio.
`StardewModdingAPI.ModBuildConfig.Analyzer.Tests` | Unit tests for the C# analyzers.

The NuGet package is generated automatically in `StardewModdingAPI.ModBuildConfig`'s `bin` folder
when you compile it.
